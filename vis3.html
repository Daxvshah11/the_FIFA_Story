            <h2 class="inference-title">Inference</h2>
            <p class="inference-text">Bar Race charts are one of the most impressive and interactive charts out there
                providing visualisation that creates sense of competitiveness. Not only this but the chart also provides
                interactability by giving the power of choice of controlling the time axis to the user. This chart right
                here clearly shows about the number of goals scored by each country over the years in FIFA.</p>
            <p class="inference-text">We can infer from this graph certain things like the primary leader currently till
                2014 dataset is Brazil with 225 goals. Moreover, no other country is that close to Brazil right now with
                Argentina running up at 133 goals only. This talks about the performace of the Brazil national team in
                big words as to how they are highly efficient in converting their opportunities to goals</p>
            <p class="inference-text">Another type of inference that we can make is by using the time stop
                functionality. We can notice patterns or trends that are linked with real world time zone like World War
                time or etc. For eg. we see that there were no FIFA during WW2 time. And then, the Brazilian team made
                post WW2 was the one that created one of the major diffferences in number of goals by scoring sheer
                massive 22 goals in just one season and thus taking a large lead!!!!</p>

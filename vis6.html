            <h2 class="inference-title">Inference</h2>
            <p class="inference-text">Multiple Parallel coordinates are really helpful when we need to compare numerous
                datapoints on more than 1 or 2 attributes. For eg. we are comparing 5 world class players in this chart
                not only in their physical terms but also in their scoring records.</p>
            <p class="inference-text">Moreover, this chart has been kept deliberately interactive as to give the freedom
                of choice for comparision between players to the user. So, if someone only wants to compare results and
                records of Messi & Ronaldo then he/she can easily do that by unchecking the other players' checkboxes.
            </p>
            <p class="inference-text">From this visualisation, we can definitely try to infer that the ratio of goal
                scoring per match for Messi is approx 0.44 wihle that for Ronaldo is approx 0.7. Thus making us infer
                that Ronaldo's conversion rate to gsuccessful goals is better than Messi. But then again, we see that
                Ronaldo is also elder to Messi and has got opportunity to play more matches than Messi when the
                comparision is being made thus giving him advantage of more experience.</p>
